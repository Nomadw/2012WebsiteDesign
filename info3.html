	Performance Issues<br>
		<p>Typically, for a high-traffic server you will need a server with large RAM capacity, and<br>
		multiple, faster processors. This allows for more requests to be dealt with at once by the<br>
		processors, and more requests to be held by the RAM to feed into the processors. (Typical server<br>
		motherboards and cases allow for more than one processor to be fitted).<br>
		High bandwidth is also required, as this allows larger amounts data to be sent and received at<br>
		higher speeds, increasing performance.<br>
		Lastly, you will need to consider what files are used on your webpages. Using large BMP files for images<br>
		and having MP3 music in the background takes up a lot of bandwidth to transfer these files to a home user's<br>
		computer, and their computer's performance can also suffer from this. Using smaller image formats, such as<br>
		GIF and JPG, are far better for speed and performance as they are far smaller files, and not using sound or<br>
		music files at all on pages is also reccomended, as generally these are not needed, are large files and<br>
		are just a nuisance to the user.<br></p>

					Client's connection speed

				<td>
					This will affect performance as the ISP will only allow a certain speed based on what package the client is paying for.

					Server Traffic

					If many clients are connected to a server at once, the server may not be able to keep up with requests.

					Client's Computer performance

					A client with a less powerful machine may not be able to view pages as fast, this is usually based on processor speed and the amount of cache memory.

					Interference

					A client on a wireless network may experience interference between the wireless card and the router, affecting performance.

				<td>
					Server's computer performance

					Smaller businesses may have less powerful servers, meaning that less requests can be performed at a time.

					Webpages with more demanding content, such as videos and larger graphics, will require more bandwidth to effectivley view, affecting performance.

					Client's browser settings

					Clients using older browsers may experience compatibility issues with more modern webpages, and some script-blocking settings may block some important scripts in a webpage.
